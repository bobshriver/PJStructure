#Data Files
#############################

AgeSt2.csv: This is primary data file containing age structure data from PJ sites.

Time- Year indicating the beginning of interval. Unit: Year Common Era (CE)

Talign- Year indicating the beginning of interval used in analysis. Only differs for Tausch paper.  Unit: Year Common Era (CE)

B- Tree establishment in interval. Unit: Varies by publication, either # of trees, proportion of trees, or density of trees that established in interval 

Location- Geographic location of study.

Source- Study citation.

Dataset- Unique identifier for each population. 

Notes- Notes about data source. 

Species: Species censused. Pinus monophylla (PiMo), Pinus edulis (PiEd), Juniperus osteosperma (JuOs), Juniperus occidentalis (JuOc), and mixed stands dominated by Pinus monophylla, with a minor Juniperus osteosperma component (PiMo-JuOs)

Interval: Interval length used for aggregating establishment years. Unit: Years

Full_census: Did census include all trees in the population? Unit: y=yes, n=no.

Census_keep- Should interval be used in analysis? For example, if census interval was incomplete, interval was not used in analysis. Unit: y=yes, n=no.

Census_notes- Notes on census approach.

Time_collected- Year in which data was collected, i.e. census year. Unit: Year Common Era (CE)

Dead_trees Were dead trees censused? Unit: y=yes, n=no.

Census_Offset Years between the end of an interval and the census year. Negative values indicate that census occurred before a interval was complete. Unit: Years

###Climate Reconstruction data###
TempRecords.csv: Reconstructed temperature records from 1600 CE from Salzer and Kipfmueller 2005

Year- Year of data. Unit: Year CE

MaxTemp- Maximum Temperature. Unit: Degrees Celsius


PrecipRecords.csv: Reconstructed precipitation records from 1600 CE from Salzer and Kipfmueller 2005

Year- Year of data. Unit: Year CE

Precip- Precipitation amount. Unit: centimeter



###Establishment data from other ecosystems###

Archer1989.csv: Establishment dates from Archer 1989. 

Time- Year indicating the beginning of interval. Unit: Year Common Era (CE)

B-Tree establishment in interval under p(wet)=0.3 scenario. Unit: % frequency 



Mastetal1999.csv: Establishment dates from Mast et al. 1999. 

Time- Year indicating the beginning of interval. Unit: Year Common Era (CE)

B-Tree establishment in interval under p(wet)=0.3 scenario. Unit: Number of trees
