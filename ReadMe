#Data Files
#############################

AgeSt2.csv: This is primary data file containing age structure data from PJ sites.

Time- Year indicating the beginning of interval. Unit: Year Common Era (CE)

Talign- Year indicating the beginning of interval used in analysis. Only differs for Tausch paper.  Unit: Year Common Era (CE)

B- Tree establishment in interval. Unit: Varies by publication, either # of trees, proportion of trees, or density of trees that established in interval 

Location- Geographic location of study.

Source- Study citation.

Dataset- Unique identifier for each population. 

Notes- Notes about data source. 

Species: Species censused. Pinus monophylla (PiMo), Pinus edulis (PiEd), Juniperus osteosperma (JuOs), Juniperus occidentalis (JuOc), and mixed stands dominated by Pinus monophylla, with a minor Juniperus osteosperma component (PiMo-JuOs)

Interval: Interval length used for aggregating establishment years. Unit: Years

Relative: Binary variable indicating whether establishment data is relativized to the total population size. Unit: 1=yes, 0=no.

DensityCon: Conversion factor based on sample size to convert relativized numbers back to total tree counts. Unitless. 

Full_census: Did census include all trees in the population? Unit: y=yes, n=no.

Census_keep- Should interval be used in analysis? For example, if census interval was incomplete, interval was not used in analysis. Unit: y=yes, n=no.

Census_notes- Notes on census approach.

Time_collected- Year in which data was collected, i.e. census year. Unit: Year Common Era (CE)

Dead_trees Were dead trees censused? Unit: y=yes, n=no.


DigCompData.CSV: Repeat measurement from single site
